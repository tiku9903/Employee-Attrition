Employee Attrition Model using Random Forest
A Random Forest model can be highly effective for predicting employee attrition by analyzing key features that contribute to employees leaving a company. The model leverages an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions, offering robustness against overfitting and providing insights into feature importance.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how to build an Employee Attrition Prediction Model using Random Forest in Python:

Steps to Build an Employee Attrition Model:
1. Problem Definition:
The goal is to predict whether an employee will leave the company (i.e., attrition) based on a set of features such as job role, satisfaction level, salary, years at the company, etc.

2. Dataset Preparation:
A typical employee attrition dataset includes columns such as:

EmployeeID: Unique identifier for employees.
Age: Age of the employee.
JobRole: The role or job title of the employee.
MonthlyIncome: Monthly salary of the employee.
YearsAtCompany: Number of years the employee has been with the company.
JobSatisfaction: Job satisfaction score.
Attrition: Whether the employee left the company or not (target variable: 1 for leaving, 0 for staying).
3. Data Preprocessing:
Data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed before being fed into the model.

Handle Missing Data: Fill or remove missing data.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Use label encoding or one-hot encoding for categorical features like JobRole.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features like MonthlyIncome and YearsAtCompany.
4. Building the Random Forest Model:
A Random Forest classifier is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy. The following steps outline how to train the model and evaluate its performance.
